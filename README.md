# universe-dawn-quest-generator
A tool to create universe dawn quests!

The Game Universe Dawn ([link](https://universe-dawn.com/)) provides quests to solve via sending credits to npcs or speaking and sovling conversation riddles with npcs.
The administrators gave the possibility that users can send a request with their own quest that then is maybe added into the game (usually it is with small modifications like quest rewards).

This tool provides a json file ready to import into the system and makes it easier for administrators to add them into the game.
